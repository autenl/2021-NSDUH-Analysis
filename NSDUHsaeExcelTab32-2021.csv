For details, see Section B of the ""2021 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology"" at https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/2021-nsduh-guide-state-tables-and-summary-sae-methodology.","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent MDE modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from adults aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older. ","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes small area estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the “Total U.S.” row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
