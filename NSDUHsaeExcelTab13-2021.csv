"NOTE: Respondents were classified as misusing opioids in the past year if they reported using heroin or misusing prescription pain relievers in the past year. Prescription pain relievers are a type of prescription psychotherapeutic. Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
