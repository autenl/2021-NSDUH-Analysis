"Table 30. Serious Mental Illness in the Past Year: Among People Aged 18 or Older; by Age Group and State, Percentages, 2021","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: Serious Mental Illness (SMI) aligns with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria and is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder. Estimates of SMI are a subset of estimates of any mental illness (AMI) because SMI is limited to people with AMI that resulted in serious functional impairment. These estimates are based on indicators of SMI rather than direct measures of diagnostic status. For details, see Section B of the ""2021 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology"" at https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/2021-nsduh-guide-state-tables-and-summary-sae-methodology.","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes small area estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the “Total U.S.” row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.","","","","","","","","","",""
