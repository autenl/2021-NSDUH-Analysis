"Table 28. Needing But Not Receiving Treatment at a Specialty Facility for Substance Use in the Past Year: Among People Aged 12 or Older; by Age Group and State, Percentages, 2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) criteria for an illicit drug or alcohol use disorder or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Substance use treatment questions are asked of respondents who used alcohol or illicit drugs in their lifetime. Respondents who used prescription drugs but who did not misuse prescription drugs in their lifetime may not receive these questions. Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.

"NOTE: Illicit drug use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana (including vaping), cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: Illicit drug or alcohol use disorder estimates are based on DSM-5 criteria. Beginning with the 2021 NSDUH, questions on prescription drug use disorder were asked of all past year users of prescription drugs, regardless of whether they misused prescription drugs. The estimates in this table do not include prescription drug use disorder data from the past year users of prescription drugs who were not also misusers of prescription drugs.

"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes small area estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the “Total U.S.” row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
