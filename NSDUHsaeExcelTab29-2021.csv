"Table 29. Any Mental Illness in the Past Year: Among People Aged 18 or Older; by Age Group and State, Percentages, 2021","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: Any Mental Illness (AMI) aligns with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria and is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder. These estimates are based on indicators of AMI rather than direct measures of diagnostic status. For details, see Section B of the ""2021 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology"" at https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/2021-nsduh-guide-state-tables-and-summary-sae-methodology.","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes small area estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the “Total U.S.” row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.","","","","","","","","","",""
