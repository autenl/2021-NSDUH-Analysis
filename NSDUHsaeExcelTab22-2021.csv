"Table 22. Pain Reliever Use Disorder in the Past Year: Among People Aged 12 or Older; by Age Group and State, Percentages, 2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: Pain Reliever Use Disorder estimates are based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) criteria. Beginning with the 2021 NSDUH, questions on prescription drug use disorder were asked of all past year users of prescription drugs, regardless of whether they misused prescription drugs. Pain relievers are a type of prescription drug. These estimates include pain reliever use disorder data from all past year users of pain relievers. ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes small area estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the “Total U.S.” row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
