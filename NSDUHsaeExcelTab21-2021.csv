"NOTE: Drug Use Disorder estimates are based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) criteria. Beginning with the 2021 NSDUH, questions on prescription drug use disorder were asked of all past year users of prescription drugs, regardless of whether they misused prescription drugs. The estimates in this table include prescription drug use disorder data from all past year users of prescription drugs. ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: Drug Use includes the use of marijuana (including vaping), cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine in the past year or any use (i.e., not necessarily misuse) of prescription pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, or sedatives in the past year.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes small area estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the “Total U.S.” row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
