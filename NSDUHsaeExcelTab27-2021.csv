"Table 27. Needing But Not Receiving Treatment at a Specialty Facility for Alcohol Use in the Past Year: Among People Aged 12 or Older; by Age Group and State, Percentages, 2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Respondents were classified as needing alcohol use treatment if they met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) criteria for an alcohol use disorder or received treatment for alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Alcohol Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing alcohol treatment but who did not receive alcohol treatment at a specialty facility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Alcohol Use Disorder estimates are based on DSM-5 criteria.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes small area estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the “Total U.S.” row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: The column labeled “Order” can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
