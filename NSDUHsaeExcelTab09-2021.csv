"NOTE: Estimates for youths aged 12 to 17 are not available for past year heroin use because past year heroin use was extremely rare among youths aged 12 to 17 in the 2021 NSDUH. As a result, estimates for people aged 12 or older are also not produced.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes small area estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the “Total U.S.” row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
